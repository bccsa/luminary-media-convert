/**
 * What the fullscreen controls offer, and how far the skip buttons move.
 *
 * `player-web` is a published library, not one app's private UI. Outside
 * fullscreen the encoder draws its own audio selector beside the player, so the
 * one in here is redundant *for the encoder* — but a consumer app has no
 * selectors of its own, and for its viewers these controls are the whole
 * surface. Removing the menu outright would take language switching away from
 * every consumer to tidy one screen. So it is configurable, and the default is
 * what the library did before this option existed.
 *
 * The skip interval is configurable for the same reason: 10 s suits a lecture
 * and 30 s a sermon, and the consumer knows which it is shipping. Back and
 * forward are separate values because they are commonly asymmetric. The
 * defaults are 10 s, because this player matches the Luminary app's chrome
 * and that is what it ships.
